PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE UPDATING AVADA. USE THE GUIDE BELOW TO SEE WHICH VERSION PERTAINS TO YOU. • If you are using Avada 1.0 to 2.1.2, then please read #1-6* If you are using Avada 2.1.3 or higher, then please read #4-6* If you are using Avada 3.0 or higher, then please note #5-61. Twitter & Flickr Widgets  - If you are using Avada 2.1 or lower, you will need to reset your flickr & twitter widgets. The API’s have changed. Please refer to the “Custom Widgets” section of our documentation for steps & a video tutorial
2. Widgets Will Become Inactive  - Upon updating to v2.1.3 or higher, your widgets will drop out of your sidebars and go into the Inactive boxes. They are not deleted, you simply need to drag & drop them back into your sidebars.
3. Many New Theme Options  - Due to over 100 new theme options, its recommended that you go through each tab and set any options that are not already set. For example, a very important option is the new line-height values on the Typography tab.  Set the default values.
4. Header Selections - Due to popular request, we’ve added the ability for users to select content for the various header areas.  If you use header 2-5, your current content will be removed when updating.  Go to the header tab in theme options, and choose your selections. You can now select what shows up in the top left & top right section. Header 4 has a unique section that also has different selections. All of this is selected on the header tab in theme options.
5. Revolution Slider Plugin - The Revolution Slider is no longer automatically activated into the theme. It needs to be activated upon install and you will get a big notice about it on wp-admin page. You will not lose any sliders OR slider page settings and revolution slider is and always will be included with the theme. Upon upgrading to v3.1.1 the integrated Revolution Slider plugin will be disabled, and you will see a notification message in the WP admin telling you that the theme requires the installation of the Revolution Slider. Choose to install it, and then activate it. All the other slider plugins (Layer Slider, Elastic Slider, Themefusion Slider, Flexslider) are still integrated. ONLY Revolution Slider is not integrated.
6. Reset Browser Cache - If you see obvious visual issues then you need to reset your browser cache. That will more than likely solve any issues you are seeing. Each browser allows you to remove cookies, history and other data.
